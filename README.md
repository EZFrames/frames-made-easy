## How it works 
- Firstly mint usdc token on base sepolia towards your address so that you can try out framify. You need to hit the mint function and you can only mint 100 usdc tokens everytime as of yet so just put your address and 100 in the amount field and you will get 100 usdc in your wallet

## Shopify Integration

Example onchain smoothie shopify store: https://my-on-chain-store.myshopify.com/

In order to use our shopify integration we require users to create a custom app with access to the ADMIN api and permissions enabled for the 'read_products' scope. See the images below.

<div><a href=""><img src="assets/shopify1.png" width="100%" /></a></div>

<div><a href=""><img src="assets/shopify2.png" width="100%" /></a></div>

We require users input the shopify url + their API key to GET their product data and create product frames.
